# Salmons Store
This project aims at applying a logistic regression to classify whether the customer will respond to Salmons promotion based on customer's last year spending (Spending) and whether they have a Salmons store credit card (Card). 


## Context


Salmons Stores operates a national chain of women’s apparel stores. Five thousand copies of an expensive four-color sales catalog have been printed, 
and each catalog includes a coupon that provides a $50 discount on purchases of $200 or more. Salmons would like to send the catalogs only to customers 
who have the highest probability of using the coupon. 
For each of 1,000 Salmons customers, three variables were tracked from an earlier promotional campaign: last year’s total spending at Salmons (Spending), whether they have a Salmons store credit card (Card), and whether they used the promotional coupon they were sent (Coupon).
